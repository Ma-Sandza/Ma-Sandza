# Jus' A Mere Dev'
Hi, I'm Sandile Moremedi, web developer from South Africa and the next come up in the self-taught route. I became a web developer because of my love for technology, which I couldn't have because I grew up with the essential needs. What my dreams are is to be a well-known person for his ability to help others through web development and helping others find there way through more things than only web dev. I have been a developer since the day I finished my grade 12 in high school, I was doing accounting, economics and pure math. Which I was never committed on doing because I didn't have the proper mindstate, but since I found web development, I know what my mission on this world is.
